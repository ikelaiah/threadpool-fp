# üöÄ ThreadPool for Free Pascal

A lightweight, easy-to-use thread pool implementation for Free Pascal. Simplify parallel processing for simple tasks! ‚ö°

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Parallel processing can improve performance for CPU-intensive tasks that can be executed independently. However, not all tasks benefit from parallelization. See [Thread Management](#-thread-management) for important considerations.

> [!NOTE]
> This library is an experimental project, as I was exploring the concept of thread pools and how to implement them in Free Pascal.
> 
> Hence, this library is **not suitable** for high-load applications. It is designed for simple parallel processing tasks that can be executed in parallel.

## ‚ú® Features & Implementations

This library provides two thread pool implementations, each with its own strengths:

### 1. üöÄ Simple Thread Pool (ThreadPool.Simple)
```pascal
uses ThreadPool.Simple;
```
- Global singleton instance for quick use
- Direct task execution
- Automatic thread count management
- Best for simple parallel tasks
- Lower memory overhead

### 2. üè≠ Producer-Consumer Thread Pool (ThreadPool.ProducerConsumer)
```pascal
uses ThreadPool.ProducerConsumer;
```
- Queue-based task processing (1024 items)
- Better for high volume tasks
- Handles queue full conditions
- More sophisticated error handling
- Full control over execution

### üéØ Shared Features

- **Thread Count Management**
  - Minimum 4 threads for optimal parallelism
  - Maximum 2√ó ProcessorCount to prevent overload
  - Fixed count after initialization
  
- **Task Types Support**
  - Simple procedures: `Pool.Queue(@MyProc)`
  - Object methods: `Pool.Queue(@MyObject.MyMethod)`
  - Indexed variants: `Pool.Queue(@MyProc, Index)`
  
- **Thread Safety**
  - Built-in synchronization
  - Safe resource sharing
  - Protected error handling
  
- **Error Management**
  - Thread-specific error capture
  - Error messages with thread IDs
  - Continuous operation after exceptions

### üîÑ Choosing an Implementation

**Use Simple Thread Pool when:**
- Quick, direct task execution needed
- Task count is moderate
- Memory overhead is a concern
- Global instance convenience desired

**Use Producer-Consumer Pool when:**
- High task volume expected
- Queue management needed
- Task buffering required
- Full execution control needed

> [!NOTE]
> Thread count is determined by `TThread.ProcessorCount` at startup and remains fixed. See [Thread Management](#-thread-management) for details.

### Example Comparison

**Simple Thread Pool:**
```pascal
uses ThreadPool.Simple;

begin
  // Use global instance
  GlobalThreadPool.Queue(@MyTask);
  GlobalThreadPool.WaitForAll;
end;
```

**Producer-Consumer Thread Pool:**
```pascal
uses ThreadPool.ProducerConsumer;

var
  Pool: TProducerConsumerThreadPool;
begin
  Pool := TProducerConsumerThreadPool.Create;
  try
    // Handle queue full condition
    try
      Pool.Queue(@MyTask);
    except
      on E: Exception do
        if E.Message = 'Queue is full' then
          // Handle full queue
    end;
    Pool.WaitForAll;
  finally
    Pool.Free;
  end;
end;
```


## üèÉ Quick Start

```pascal
program QuickStart;

{$mode objfpc}{$H+}{$J-}

uses
  Classes, SysUtils, ThreadPool.Simple;  // Note the .Simple unit suffix

// Simple parallel processing
procedure ProcessItem(index: Integer);
begin
  WriteLn('Processing item: ', index);
end;

var
  i: Integer;
begin
  // Queue multiple items for parallel processing
  for i := 1 to 5 do
    GlobalThreadPool.Queue(@ProcessItem, i);
    
  // Wait for all tasks to complete
  GlobalThreadPool.WaitForAll;
end.
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

```pascal
program ErrorHandling;

{$mode objfpc}{$H+}{$J-}

uses
  Classes, SysUtils, ThreadPool.Simple;

procedure RiskyProcedure;
begin
  raise Exception.Create('Something went wrong!');
end;

var
  Pool: TSimpleThreadPool;
begin
  Pool := TSimpleThreadPool.Create(4); // Create with 4 threads
  try
    Pool.Queue(@RiskyProcedure);
    Pool.WaitForAll;
    
    // Check for errors after completion
    if Pool.LastError <> '' then
    begin
      WriteLn('An error occurred: ', Pool.LastError);
      Pool.ClearLastError;  // Clear for reuse if needed
    end;
  finally
    Pool.Free;
  end;
end.
```

### üí° Tips

> [!NOTE]
> - üõ°Ô∏è Exceptions in worker threads are caught and stored
> - üîç Error messages include thread IDs for debugging
> - ‚ö° The pool continues operating after exceptions
> - üîÑ Error state can be cleared for reuse


### üõ†Ô∏è Custom Thread Pool

```pascal
var
  CustomPool: TSimpleThreadPool;
begin
  CustomPool := TSimpleThreadPool.Create(4);  // Minimum allowed threads
  try
    CustomPool.Queue(@MyProcedure);
    CustomPool.WaitForAll;
  finally
    CustomPool.Free;
  end;
end;
```

### üõ†Ô∏è When to Use Each 
    
**GlobalThreadPool**
- Simple parallel tasks
- One-off parallel operations
- When default thread count is sufficient
    
**TSimpleThreadPool**
- Custom thread count needs
- Multiple independent thread pools
- Advanced error handling needs
- When you need control over pool lifetime

2. Choose your implementation:
   
   For Simple Thread Pool:
   ```pascal
   uses ThreadPool.Simple;
   ```
   
   For Producer-Consumer Thread Pool:
   ```pascal
   uses ThreadPool.ProducerConsumer;
   ```

3. Start using:
   - Simple: Use `GlobalThreadPool` or create `TSimpleThreadPool`
   - Producer-Consumer: Create `TProducerConsumerThreadPool`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- üíª Free Pascal 3.2.2 or later
- üì¶ Lazarus 3.6.0 or later
- üÜì No external dependencies


## üìö Documentation

- [ThreadPool.Simple API Documentation](docs/ThreadPool.Simple-API.md)
- [ThreadPool.Simple Technical Details](docs/ThreadPool.Simple-Technical.md)
- [ThreadPool.ProducerConsumer API Documentation](docs/ThreadPool.ProducerConsumer-API.md)
- [ThreadPool.ProducerConsumer Technical Details](docs/ThreadPool.ProducerConsumer-Technical.md)

## üß™ Testing

1. Go to the `tests/` directory
2. Open `TestRunner.lpi` in Lazarus IDE and compile
3. Run `./TestRunner.exe -a -p --format=plain` to see the test results.
4. Ensure all tests pass to verify the library's functionality

May take up to 5 mins to run all tests.

## üßµ Thread Management

### Default Behavior
The `GlobalThreadPool` creates threads with these safety limits:
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Values below 4 are increased to 4
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Values above 2√ó ProcessorCount are reduced
- üéØ Invalid values (‚â§ 0) default to [TThread.ProcessorCount](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/classes/tthread.processorcount.html)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Thread count is automatically adjusted to safe limits.

> [!TIP]
> The thread pool automatically manages safe thread counts:
> - Prevents too few threads (< 4) that could limit parallelism
> - Prevents too many threads that could overwhelm the system
> - Maintains reasonable scaling with available processors
> - No need to manually calculate safe limits
